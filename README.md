# Linear-Regression

In this project, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data.
This project is in Matlab.
Files needed for this project -

1. ex1.mlx - MATLAB Live Script that steps you through the exercise
2. ex1data1.txt - Dataset for linear regression with one variable
3. ex1data2.txt - Dataset for linear regression with multiple variables
4. *warmUpExercise.m - Simple example function in MATLAB
5. *plotData.m - Function to display the dataset
6. *computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression
7. *gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent
8. **computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables
9. **gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables
10. **featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features
11. **normalEqn.m - Function to compute the normal equations

*indicates files you will need to complete
**indicates optional exercises

Above all files are added in this repository.
If you have any doubt then feel free to comment in discussion section.
